# Thirtysix Studio-clone (creative development)

This is a clone of the Thirtysix Studio website, built using Vite, Canvas, and GSAP.

The website uses a combination of HTML5 Canvas and GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform) to create a visually striking and interactive experience. The website is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
